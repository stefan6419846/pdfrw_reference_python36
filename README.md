# Reference files for pdfrw

Generate reference files for [pdfrw](https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw) for the time when
all tests still passed to use them for further comparisons when evaluating forks/changes
for more recent Python versions after the upstream development has stalled.

Please note that even Python 3.6 does not generate fully matching files, thus you probably
want to use the Python 3.5 files. The corresponding artifacts are provided/archived as
releases of this repository.
